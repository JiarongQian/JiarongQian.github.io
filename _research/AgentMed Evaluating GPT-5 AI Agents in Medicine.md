## Project Objective:
To evaluate how successive advancements from base LLMs to autonomous GPT-5 agents impact clinical reasoning and diagnostic accuracy.

## Main Output:
○	Developed a multi-modal open-ended QA benchmark (196 cases with verified ground truth) for evaluating model performance in real-world diagnostic scenarios.
○	Proposed a comprehensive evaluation framework for open-ended answers, assessing both accuracy and reasoning process.
○	Conducted an in-depth analysis of performance differences and impacts among LLM-based, Web Search, and Agent-based approaches in diagnosis.
○	Built a GitHub Page to present the overall workflow, evaluation process, and results.
