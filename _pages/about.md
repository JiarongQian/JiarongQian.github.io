I am currently a final-year student at Shandong University in China. My undergraduate thesis is co-supervised by <a href="scholar.google.com/citations?user=ooqH5wcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank">Prof. Peng Xue</a> from Shandong University and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bI_qetYAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Lei Ma</a> from Tongji University. At the same time, I am also working as a research intern under the supervision of Prof. Jing Huang at the University of Pennsylvania.

My areas of greatest interest include:
1) Healthcare AI;
2) Human-centered AI
3) Computational social science.
4) Safe and Responsible AI

The core question I’m interested in is how to use artificial intelligence to promote healthier human development (physical health/mental health).<br>
On one hand, I hope to advance clinical pathway optimization and everyday healthcare applications through multimodal approaches and efficient deep learning systems. At the same time, I have a strong interest in the interpretability and safety of medical AI, and I aspire to contribute to building trustworthy, general-purpose artificial intelligence (AGI) systems for computational precision medicine and health. <br>
On the other hand, I hope to leverage AI for social computing to support marginalized communities—such as the elderly and individuals with mental health conditions—and to promote social awareness and progress.<br>
