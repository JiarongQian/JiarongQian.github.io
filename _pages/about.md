I am currently a senior student at Shandong University.

My research combines social science with machine learning, aiming to develop AI that is most suitable for humans.
The core question I'm interested in is how to use artificial intelligence to promote healthier human development (physical health/mental health).

My areas of greatest interest include:
1) Healthcare AI;
2) Human-centered AI
3) Computational social science.
4) Safe and Responsible AI
