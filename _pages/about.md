I am currently a senior student at Shandong University.<br>

My research combines social science with machine learning, aiming to develop AI that is most suitable for humans.<br>
The core question I'm interested in is how to use artificial intelligence to promote healthier human development (physical health/mental health).<br>

My areas of greatest interest include:<br>
1) Healthcare AI;<br>
2) Human-centered AI<br>
3) Computational social science.<br>
4) Safe and Responsible AI<br>
