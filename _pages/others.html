## Film Creation
When I was 17 years old, I dreamed of becoming a director, but due to some other reasons, I didn't choose to attend a media college.

However!

When I was 20 years old, I won the Excellence Award at the Macau International Film Festival Script Investment Competition (if you're interested, I've included a link to the script, which is a suspenseful love story).

I am also a producer of a theatrical film.

So I want to say, never, never give up on your dreams, as they are where your passion and talent lie.

Film script creation is a process of communicating with different humans, expressing the psychology and dilemmas of different humans.

It is an outlet for all social phenomena and emotions that humans want to focus on, and it's also my outlet.

Humans have existed for tens of thousands of years, constantly creating and spreading stories.

## Hobbies and Interests
I also love music (I listen to all types of music).

I really like K-POP and bands!

If there's a chance, I hope to form a band in the future.
