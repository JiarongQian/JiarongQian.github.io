## Film Creation
When I was 17 years old, I dreamed of becoming a director, but due to some other reasons, I didn't choose to attend a media college.<br><br>
However!<br><br>
When I was 20 years old, I won the Excellence Award at the Macau International Film Festival Script Investment Competition (if you're interested, I've included a link to the script, which is a suspenseful love story).<br><br>
I am also a producer of a theatrical film.<br><br>
So I want to say, never, never give up on your dreams, as they are where your passion and talent lie.<br><br>
Film script creation is a process of communicating with different humans, expressing the psychology and dilemmas of different humans.<br><br>
It is an outlet for all social phenomena and emotions that humans want to focus on, and it's also my outlet.<br><br>
Humans have existed for tens of thousands of years, constantly creating and spreading stories.

## Hobbies and Interests
I also love music (I listen to all types of music).<br><br>
I really like K-POP and bands!<br><br>
If there's a chance, I hope to form a band in the future.
